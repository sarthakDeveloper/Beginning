# Beginning
This is the first repository i am creating on github. Basically, I am by creating this repository, I am figuring out how github works.
okay, i will write some more lines just to fill some lines, then we will me further.


right now, i am inside the branch, and making changes in this branch.
now if i commit this changes and then make a pull request, then the main will save the changes we are making in this branch.
